(A) Cores/processors on my computer: 2.

(B) The computation time after running the sequential.cpp program: 1.2 seconds.

(C) The computation time after running thee parallel.cpp program: 0.536 seconds.

(D) The computation time after changing the number of threads from 30 to 1000 in parallel.cpp: 14.7 seconds.

(E) The computation time after changing the number of threads from 1000 to 2 in parallel.cpp: 0.750 seconds

(F) The sample output was created with a computer that has 14 cores. Did I get the same numbers as the
sample output? Why or why not?
ANSWER: NO, I didn't get the exact number. Because, I had less cores integrated in my laptop. Cores are like extra helping hands. Meaning, if they have 14 helpers (cores), their processor can work on 14 parts at once and they get the job done faster than me with 2 helpers (cores). More cores mean more parts can be worked on at the same time, so the whole task finishes quicker.
